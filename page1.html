	<li> it’s possible to serve sushi on any plate, and for more casual sushi like temaki sushi, something decorative might not be necessary. But for many, sushi is reserved for a special occasion, so requires special tableware to fit that occasion. </li>

	<li>A Japanese meal typically involves several smaller dishes served at once, rather than one focus dish. So, with moritsuke, the individuality of each dish is highlighted to create an inviting dinner scene</li>

	<li> To make your dinner table look aesthetically pleasing the Japanese way, it’s important to pay attention to the seasons, and to pair your plates with your food. For example, this dark colored bizen ware plate like this could be perfect in autumn or winter paired with smaller plates of similar colours. Or, it could make a nice contrast piece, as the darker colours will contrast with the white of the sushi rice, and could be complemented by smaller white dishes with dark toppings.</li>

	<li> Bizen ware ceramics are a good example. During the long wood-firing process, the artisan doesn’t touch the wares, so it takes years of experience to know how to place the ceramics in the kiln to achieve the greatest outcome. The final appearance of each piece is not entirely predictable, making every dish or teacup wholly original and unique. Making Bizen pottery is so arduous that most kilns only do a firing once or twice a year, or even less. </li>
