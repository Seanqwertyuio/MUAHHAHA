	<li>Aburi is a Japanese preparation of fish sushi quickly broiled using a blow torch/ kitchen torch. The word “aburi” means “flame seared” in Japanese. The technique is used to gently sear the surface of the fish to create a contrast in texture of a grilled surface and creamy, raw underside of the fish.  </li>

	<li>In this Japanese preparation sushi grade salmon is thinly sliced and quickly seared using a kitchen torch until the top is just cooked. I top it off with a splash of ponzu sauce, a sprinkle of green onions and toasted sesame seeds.</li>

	<li>he seared salmon nigiri from Fuji at Kendall is one of my favorite things on their menu. It’s savory and luxurious, thanks to the chili garlic oil, which comes with crunchy pieces of fried garlic, and the creamy slices of salmon. A drizzle of unagi sauce and thinly sliced scallions round it up very nicely.</li>
