<li>Genki Sushi was founded in 1968 with the promise of bringing sushi to the masses.
Today, now that Kaiten Sushi has become more familiar to the general population,our nextaim is to make our brand synonymous with sushi.</li>

<li>Genki Sushi is a chain of conveyor belt sushi restaurants established in 1990 in Japan. The chain expanded to include locations in Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Kuwait, the Philippines, China, Australia, Cambodia, Myanmar and the American states of California, Hawaii and Washington.</li>

<li>Genki is a Japanese word which roughly translated means fine / in good health / has an abundance of energy. But when you put it next to Sushi, it means really bloody good.</li>
